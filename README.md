# Health-Costs-Calculator

## Repository Content

In this repository you’ll find the “Health Costs Calculator” project, a machine learning application that uses a linear regression algorithm to estimate individuals’ medical care costs. The code is fully modularized—allowing you to train, evaluate, predict, and test independently—so you don’t have to run the entire program from start to finish each time. Additionally, the `notebooks` folder contains the complete project notebook associated with the “Machine Learning with Python” certification

## Technologies Used

- Language: Python
- Framework: TensorFlow
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, Pytest

## Project Execution Notes

Note that to fully run this project using the run_all.sh script, you must open a Linux Bash terminal.

Feel free to run whichever commands are necessary to train, evaluate, predict, or run the tests without relying on the `run_all.sh` script. Since the project’s code is divided into separate components, you don’t need to execute the entire program at once to use the model for prediction or testing.

To run this project successfully, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the project’s root directory and run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment that isolates the project and ensures it runs correctly.

3. Finally, execute the command `sh run_all.sh`, which will start the program in its entirety.
